	<p><i>i don’t smoke</i></p>
	tendrils of white 
	<br> escape my mouth
	<br> a slight burning in the lungs.
	<br> deep breaths to 
	<br> ward off the chill,
	<br> a fire aflame inside.
	<br> red nose
	<br> face frozen
	<br> one more puff
	<br> of sweet nicotine
	<br> to turn pink, black.
	<br> this lifeline 
	<br> oxygen mask of mine,
	<br> i inhale it to survive. 
	<br> each stick,
	<br> a forest fire spreading. </p>

	I consider myself one of them. 
	<br>No discernable difference it seems 
	<br>until I open my mouth. <br>
	
	<br>That’s when they realize.<br>
	
	<br><i>Wai guo ren,</i> they say with disdain, 
	<br>in the language they presume 
	<br>I don’t understand, 
	<br>but do. <br>

	<br>They switch to ​<i>ying wen,</i> 
	<br>but I play the same game 
	<br>and reply in their tongue​​
	<br>— our tongue.   

	<br>Eying me up and down, 
	<br>I see their minds tinkering, 
	<br>wondering whether or not to let me in. <br>  

	<br>I’ll wait outside until they do.

	<p><i>Miss Guy</i></p>
	Miss Guy sits inside a bookstore café 
	<br>named  after a year that existed before she did  
	<br>she pretends to read the pages of words on white 
	<br>lines fill her mind as she instead eyes the people around  
	<br>her are shelves packed with yellowed paper 
	<br>bundled into nooks that look as if the last 
	<br>time they’ve seen open air was when anyone cared to read print. <br>  

	<br>Miss Guy takes turns with her misguided reflection
	<br>wondering how long it’ll take to return to the right
	<br>path how long to burn the bridges of her past that led to this
	<br>moment she stands in front of a cracked mirror
	<br>its fissures webbing into the face of a broken china doll.

	rising rays of our sacred sun

	<br>of Fushimi-inari 
	<br>red hot and fiery 
	<br>the shrines stand ablaze 
	<br>among mountain trails 
	<br>as a heat stroke plays 
	<br>with the mind 
	<br>warm tones of our breaths  
	<br>and the earth’s 
	<br>fuse until there is no 
	<br>distinguishing one from the other 
	<br>we are engulfed 
	<br>melded together 
	<br>ancient scrawls branded  
	<br>into our blood.

	<i id="tokyo1">On the Streets of Tokyo</i>
	<br>neon characters echo 
	<br>vague tones of the motherland, 
	<br>giving way to alien sounds 
	<br>as words flow into 
	<br>eager ears. <br>  

	<br>curves of rounded brush strokes 
	v<br>soften the local’s smile,
	<br>a display of gratitude in a slight bow, 
	<br>a parting gift. <br>  

	<br>an attempt to reciprocate, 
	<br>a mumbling of ​arigatou 
	<br>as suited men and women flock onwards, 
	<br>wings flapping as the breeze carries sleeves and ties with it. <br>  

	<br>there goes the crowd as 
	<br>warm air follows them into the ​izakayas
​ 	<br>next door, sounds of laughter tumbling 
	<br>out into the streets like the men 
	<br>who’ve had too much to drink.   <br>

	<br>they clink sake shots to the setting sun 
	<br>cheers ringing out amongst them, 
	<br>a toast to this Tokyo evening 
	<br>and the chance to do it again tomorrow. <br>

	she watches the sky
	<br>dip below blue
	<br> from behind the glass window.
	<br> fingers extended,
	<br> they lightly trace
	<br> the horizon's silhouette,
	<br> a burst of orange on her tongue.
	<br> arms longing
	<br> arms falling
	<br> the warmth recedes into the night
	<br> pulling a piece of her with it.
	<br> she picks one out
	<br> from the bowl,
	<br> its scent still fresh.
	<br> her own little sunset,
	<br> skin on flesh. </p>
