		<br> a fire aflame inside.

		<br> to turn pink, black.

		I consider myself one of them. 
		<br>No discernable difference it seems 
		<br>until I open my mouth. <br>
		
		<br>That’s when they realize.<br>
		
		<br><i>Wai guo ren,</i> they say with disdain, 
		<br>in the language they presume 
		<br>I don’t understand, 
		<br>but do. <br>

		<br>They switch to ​<i>ying wen,</i> 
		<br>but I play the same game 
		<br>and reply in their tongue​​
		<br>— our tongue.   <br>

		<br>Eying me up and down, 
		<br>I see their minds tinkering, 
		<br>wondering whether or not to let me in. <br>  

		<br>I’ll wait outside until they do.

		<p><i>Miss Guy</i></p>
		Miss Guy sits inside a bookstore café 
		<br>named  after a year that existed before she did  
		<br>she pretends to read the pages of words on white 
		<br>lines fill her mind as she instead eyes the people around  
		<br>her are shelves packed with yellowed paper 
		<br>bundled into nooks that look as if the last 
		<br>time they’ve seen open air was when anyone cared to read print. <br>  

		<br>Miss Guy doesn’t buy the crap on movie screens
		<br>where boy and girl teens fall forever in love
		<br>this love doesn’t exist doesn’t persist like they 
		<br>told her lies because in the short time she lived half way across 
		<br>the world she watched the hearts of four counterparts 
		<br>hurled into the ocean divided lovers no more.<br>


		<br>Miss Guy takes turns with her misguided reflection
		<br>wondering how long it’ll take to return to the right
		<br>path how long to burn the bridges of her past that led to this
		<br>moment she stands in front of a cracked mirror
		<br>its fissures webbing into the face of a broken china doll.

	<div id="motherland">
		<p><i>Motherland: Lianjiang, Fujian</i></p>
		I was nine the last time I set foot here. 
		<br>I think it’s been ten and a half years. 
	 	<br>
		<br>I used to think those four flights of stairs were neverending, always coming up last and out of breath. 
		<br>I climb them easily today, my steps surpassing my mother’s as I wait for her to join me at the top. 
		<br>I used to like looking down the railing of each floor and onto the lobby’s ground, spying on the adults when they weren’t watching. 
		<br>I don’t like how this white plaster prevents me from doing so now. 
		<br>I can see the shadows of my sister and brother and cousin running around in the summer heat,  squealing as sweat drips down our backs. 
		<br>I see the hunched silhouette of my great grandmother in the corner, closing the door on us to nap in  peace. 
		<br>I try the knob, but the room that belonged to her is locked and empty. 
	 	<br>
		<br>I walk with my mother and her mother towards the home of my father’s mother, a few blocks away. 
		<br>I notice little has changed around here, rickshaws still in service and infrastructure still outdated. 
		<br>I smile at a woman washing clothes in an outdoor sink, sheets blowing on the lines behind her. 
		<br>I breathe in the air, its scent reminding me of steaming street-cart noodles on a hot afternoon. 
		<br>I wonder how things can feel so familiar yet so foreign. 
	 	<br>
		<br>I arrive at her building and trek up to floor three.  
		<br>I have to knock loudly, ring the doorbell, call her phone, because she’s hard of hearing these days. 
		<br>I greet her with a hug and help her to the couch, slow and steady, they say. 
		<br>I watch my uncle set up the teapot, spilling out old water and tearing open a new packet of leaves. 
		<br>I’ve always loved the smell of tea leaves. 
		<br>I stare at my grandpa’s portrait hanging above the adults as they discuss her bad knee and how it’s not getting any better.
		<br>I tune them out. 
		<br>I feel a slight knot in my stomach, nose stinging as I continue to stare at his frozen smile. 
		<br>I never grieved because it had felt too distant then, both physically and mentally.  
		<br>I feel guilty now because I can no longer pretend; his absence is deafening. 
		<br>I look away. 
	 	<br>
		<br>I say goodbye and realize that this Lianjiang is not the same one I visited when I was nine. 
	 	<br>
		<br>Nothing stays the same forever, I guess.

		<p><i>appendicitis blues</i></p>  
		seven days in a hospital bed will make you lose your mind 
		<br>churn your brain into the mess that your digestive tract has become 
		<br>that sharp pain you felt a few days ago is nothing compared to the 
		<br>suffocation caused by this tiny dull room whose window overlooks 
		<br>the prettiest piece of sky that teases your eyes with a luxury you can’t have. 
		<br>the breeze that billows in tickles the sweaty nape of your neck 
		<br>as your back bends towards it the way green stems do towards sunlight and laughter 
		<br>with a slow arch of the spine 
		<br>you ignore the dull throbbing on your right side 
		<br>unclench fists pumped with saline and liquid life 
		<br>and exhale a quivering breath as you watch the sun dip behind Xintiandi lights, 
		<br>the signal of another day gone.

	<div id="skin">
		<p><i>skin and bones</i></p>
		I was left with three scars. 
		<br>Tiny straight lines that form 
		<br>an isosceles triangle when
		<br>you connect them all together.
	<br>
		<br>I like to think of them as 
		<br>my own constellation, 
		<br>a look into the past, the unknown.  
	<br>
		<br>Unknown because pink flesh 
		<br>stares back at me as I recall the 
		<br>moment I lay on the operation table, 
		<br>white ceiling lights beating down 
		<br>the way they show in movies. 
		<br>I remember nothing else.
	<br>
		<br>But these marks remind me 
		<br>how easily I can be cut into, 
		<br>punctured, and torn open. 
		<br>My body is just a palette of skin, 
		<br>waiting to be played with.   
	<br>
		<br>Knives are as sharp as words, 
		<br>not the other way around.

		<br>to Pyramid
		<br>to join the crowd
